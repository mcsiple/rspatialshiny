# Shiny intro

# This is a Shiny web application. In RStudio you can run the application by clicking 'Run App' button above.

### Example 1: orange trees
# Tasks to try: 
# - Change what the user sees in the selectInput menu to “Tree 1”, “Tree 2”, and “Tree 3”
# - Use `h6()` to put text above each plot describing what it does
# - Change the color of the histogram to orange

library(shiny)
library(scales)

# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("A simple app"),
   # The following text will appear below the title. h1 is big text, h6 is small.
   h5("This app plots orange tree data from three different trees."),
   # Sidebar with checkbox input 
   sidebarLayout( # This defines the layout of the whole page.
      # Other options include tabsetPanel(), navlistPanel()
      sidebarPanel(  # Everything in sidebarPanel() describes the contents of the sidebar in the UI
         checkboxGroupInput(inputId = "treeID", # inputID links ui to the server logic
                            label = "Tree number:", # The label is what the user sees
                            c("1" = 1, 
                              "2" = 2,
                              "3" = 3),
                            selected="1" # Default selection
         )
      ),
      
      # Show plots
      mainPanel(
         plotOutput("orangePlot"),
         plotOutput("orangeHist")
      )
   ) # end of sidebarLayout
)

# Define server logic required to plot
server <- function(input, output) {
   
   # Scatterplot
   output$orangePlot <- renderPlot({
      # subset to the trees that the user selected:
      which.trees <- input$treeID
      tree <- subset(Orange,Tree %in% which.trees)
      
      # Plot data for the selected trees:
      x <- tree$age
      y <- tree$circumference
      plot(x,y,
           xlab="Age (days)",ylab="Circumference (mm)",
           pch=19, cex=2,col=alpha("forestgreen",0.5))
   })
   
   # Histogram
   output$orangeHist <- renderPlot({
      which.trees <- input$treeID
      tree <- subset(Orange,Tree %in% which.trees) 
      # Notice, you have to define tree again in this function
      
      hist(tree$circumference,
           col=alpha("forestgreen",0.5),
           main="",
           xlab="Circumference (mm)")
   })
}
